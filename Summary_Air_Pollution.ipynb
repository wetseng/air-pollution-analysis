    "Team Magical Ligers set out to explore pollution measurements and dissect data to answer the questions we collectively discussed. Los Angeles has always been surround by smog. We were curious about the air quality standards in LA and around the United States. Does the United States population care, or aware of what is considered good and moderate air quality? Will EV cars help with pollution? Lastly, the recent Covid pandemic led us to realize air pollution has cleared due to quarantine. When the quarantine is lifted, should we continue to wear masks?<br>\n",
